Feature: Configure/build freestyle jobs
  In order to get some basic usage out of freestyle jobs
  As a user
  I want to configure and run a series of different freestyle-based jobs

     THIS TEST IS ALREADY PORTED OVER TO JAVA AS-IS. NO NEED TO PORT TO JUNIT
  **********************************************************************************

  Scenario: Create a simple job
    When I create a job named "MAGICJOB"
    And I visit the home page
    Then the page should say "MAGICJOB"

  Scenario: Run a simple job
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I add a shell build step "ls"
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    Then console output should contain "+ ls"

  Scenario: Disable a job
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I check the "disable" checkbox
    And I save the job
    And I visit the job page
    Then the page should say "This project is currently disabled"

  Scenario: Enable concurrent builds
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I enable concurrent builds
    And I add a shell build step "sleep 20"
    And I save the job
    And I build 2 jobs
    Then the 2 builds should run concurrently

  Scenario: Create a parameterized job
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I add a string parameter "Foo"
    And I add a string parameter "Bar"
    And I add a shell build step "echo $Foo '!=' $Bar"
    And I save the job
    And I build the job with parameters
        | Foo | val |
        | Bar | var |
    Then the build should succeed
    And console output should contain "val != var"

  Scenario: Disable a job
    Given a job
    When I disable the job
    Then it should be disabled
    And it should have an "Enable" button on the job page

  Scenario: Old build should be discarded
    Given a simple job
    When I configure the job
    And I set 2 builds to keep
    And I save the job
    And I build 4 jobs sequentially
    Then the job should not have build 1
    And  the job should not have build 2
    And  the job should have build 3
    And  the job should have build 4
    And  the job should not have build 5

  Scenario: Schedule build from view
    When I create a job named "viewed_job"
    And I visit the home page
    And I build "viewed_job" in view
    Then the build should succeed

  Scenario: Schedule parameterized build from view
    When I create a job named "viewed_job"
    When I configure the job
    And I add a string parameter "Foo"
    And I save the job
    And I visit the home page
    And I build "viewed_job" in view
    Then the page should say "This build requires parameters:"
    Then the page should say "Foo"

  Scenario: Do not discard build kept forever
    Given a simple job
    When I configure the job
    And I set 1 build to keep
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    And I lock the build
    And I build 2 jobs sequentially
    Then the job should have build 1
    And  the job should not have build 2
    And  the job should have build 3
    And  the job should not have build 4

  Scenario: Do not discard last successful build
    Given a simple job
    When I configure the job
    And I set 1 build to keep
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    And I configure the job
    And I add always fail build step
    And I save the job
    And I build 2 jobs sequentially
    Then the job should have build 1
    And  the job should not have build 2
    And  the job should have build 3
    And  the job should not have build 4

  Scenario: Archive artifact and check content of archived artifact
    Given a job
    When I add a shell build step "echo 'archive test' > test.txt" in the job configuration
    And I set artifact "test.txt" to archive in the job configuration
    And I build the job
    Then the build should succeed
    And console output should contain "Archiving artifacts"
    And the artifact "test.txt" should be archived
    And the content of artifact "test.txt" should be "archive test"

  Scenario: Archive artifact and exclude another
    Given a job
    When I add a shell build step in the job configuration
        """
            echo 'archive include test' > test1.txt
            echo 'archive exclude test' > test2.txt
        """
    And I set artifact "test1.txt" to archive and exclude "test2.txt" in the job configuration
    And I build the job
    Then the build should succeed
    And the artifact "test1.txt" should be archived
    And the artifact "test2.txt" should not be archived

  Scenario: Schedule build periodically
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I schedule job to run periodically at "* * * * *"
    And I save the job
    And I wait for 70 seconds
    Then the job should have build 1
    # number 2 might exist
    And  the job should not have build 3

  Scenario: Format zero-sized artifact size properly
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I add a shell build step "touch empty.file"
    And I set artifact "empty.file" to archive
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    Then the size of artifact "empty.file" should be "0 B"

  Scenario: Use custom workspace
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I use "custom_workspace" as custom workspace
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    Then console output should match "^Building in workspace (.*)custom_workspace$"

  Scenario: Show error message after apply
    Given a job
    When I configure the job
    And I schedule job to run periodically at "not_a_time"
    And I click the "Apply" button
    Then the error description should contain
        """
        Invalid input: "not_a_time"
        """
    And I close the error dialog
    And I schedule job to run periodically at "not_a_time_either"
    And I click the "Apply" button
    Then the error description should contain
        """
        Invalid input: "not_a_time_either"
        """
